flexbox.html
======

It is a repository to practice flexbox, css__grid, BEM and incorporate sass in my workflow
------

I have made this whole website complete from scratch without looking at any code from the w3schools given free templates to practice 

You can refer the source from which i saw the UI at 
[w3schools.com/free__templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_food_blog.htm "w3schools source")
